In Typescript.

To run with your test data,
```
mkdir -p input
````
then save each day's input to `input/day1`, `input/day2` and so on.

Setup:

```shell
yarn
yarn build
```

Running all tests, and all days + parts:

```
yarn start
```

Running a specific day / part with your input data, e.g. day 15 part 2:

```
yarn start 15 2
```
