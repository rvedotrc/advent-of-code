# Advent Of Code 2019

https://adventofcode.com/2019

I'm using my comfort language, Ruby, specifically 2.6.3 (see `.ruby-version`).

My code is in `lib`; `gem install bundler`, `bundle install`, `rspec`
should be sufficient to run the tests.

To actually get the solutions proper, `mkdir input`, save each day's input to
`input/day01` and so forth, then run the various things in `bin`.
