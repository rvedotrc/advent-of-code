In Ruby / Typescript.

To run with your test data,
```
mkdir -p input

## Ruby

```
bundle
bundle exec rspec
````

Running a specific day / part with your input data, e.g. day 3 part 1:

```
bundle exec ./bin/test 3 1
```

## Typescript

Setup (no tests yet):

```shell
yarn
yarn build
```

Running a specific day / part with your input data, e.g. day 15 part 2:
